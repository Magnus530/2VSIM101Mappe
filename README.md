# Terrain-and-physics-simulation

Terrain-and-physics-simulation is a Github repository created to simulate physics on terrain.

The terrain is read from map data downloaded in the LIDAR format and rendered using a triangulation method.
Blue spheres simulate rain falling on the surface of the terrain. The blue lines are drawn to show the stream of water that forms after the raindrops.

Created by Magnus Furberg, Ali Al-Awadi and Petter RÃ¸rtveit in the fifth semester of the B2VISIM bachelor.
