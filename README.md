2VSIM101Mappe is a Github repository created to simulate physics on terrain.

The terrain is read from map data downloaded in the LIDAR format and rendered using a triangulation method.
Blue spheres simulate rain falling on the surface of the terrain. The blue lines are drawn to show the stream of water that forms after the raindrops.
